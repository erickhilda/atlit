# atlit — Atlassian context CLI

> A lightweight CLI that pulls Atlassian content -- Jira tickets, Bitbucket PRs, and Confluence pages -- into local markdown files for offline access and LLM context feeding.

---

## Vision

A simple, fast, Go-based CLI (inspired by `gh`, `gcloud`, `bird`) that bridges Jira Cloud and your local filesystem. Pull tickets once, work offline, refresh when needed. No browser, no copy-paste.

**Core workflow:**

```
atlit pull PROJ-123        →  ~/.atlit/tickets/PROJ-123.md
atlit pull PROJ-123        →  updates the same file with latest content
cat ~/.atlit/tickets/PROJ-123.md | claude   →  instant context
```

---

## Local File Format

Each ticket becomes a self-contained markdown file:

```markdown
<!-- atlit:meta ticket=PROJ-123 fetched=2026-02-14T10:30:00Z -->

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 0 — Project Setup (Day 1) [DONE]

- [x] Initialize Go module (`github.com/erickhilda/atlit`)
- [x] Set up project structure (see Architecture below)
- [x] Choose CLI framework: **cobra** (industry standard, used by `kubectl`, `gh`, `hugo`)
- [x] Set up CI with goreleaser for cross-platform binaries
- [ ] Write README with installation instructions

### Phase 1 — Auth & Config (Days 2–3) [DONE]

**Goal:** Connect to Jira Cloud securely.

- [x] `atlit init` — Interactive setup wizard
  - Prompt for Jira instance URL (`https://yourcompany.atlassian.net`)
  - Prompt for email + API token (masked input via `x/term`)
  - Prompt for default project key (optional)
  - Save config to `~/.atlit/config.yaml`
  - Verify credentials via `/rest/api/3/myself`
- [x] `atlit config set <key> <value>` — Update individual settings
- [x] `atlit config show` — Display current config (mask token)
- [x] Store API token securely (system keyring via `go-keyring`, fallback to `~/.atlit/credentials` with 0600 perms)
- [x] `atlit auth test` — Verify credentials work

**Config file (`~/.atlit/config.yaml`):**

```yaml
instance: https://yourcompany.atlassian.net
email: you@company.com
default_project: PROJ
tickets_dir: ~/.atlit/tickets    # configurable
token_storage: keyring         # or "file" if keyring unavailable
```

### Phase 2 — Pull & View (Days 4–7) [DONE]

**Goal:** Fetch tickets and save as local markdown.

- [x] `atlit pull <TICKET-KEY>` — Fetch ticket from Jira REST API v3, render to markdown, save to `tickets_dir`
  - Fetches: summary, description, status, assignee, reporter, priority, type, labels, sprint, epic, comments, subtasks, linked issues
  - Converts Jira's ADF (Atlassian Document Format) to markdown
  - Saves as `<TICKET-KEY>.md`
  - If file exists, overwrites with fresh content (preserves any local `## Notes` section — see below)
- [x] `atlit pull <TICKET-KEY> --comments-only` — Only update the comments section
- [x] `atlit pull <TICKET-KEY> --dry-run` — Show diff of what would change
- [x] `atlit view <TICKET-KEY>` — Print local markdown to stdout (for piping)
- [x] `atlit open <TICKET-KEY>` — Open ticket in default browser
- [x] `atlit path <TICKET-KEY>` — Print the file path (useful for scripts: `claude < $(atlit path PROJ-123)`)
- [x] Handle ADF → Markdown conversion:
  - Headings, paragraphs, lists (ordered/unordered)
  - Code blocks (with language)
  - Tables
  - Mentions (@user)
  - Links, images (media nodes -> markdown image refs + an `## Attachments` section, Phase 9) — **Tier 1 done; inline local download (Tier 2) deferred**
  - Panels (info/warning/error → blockquotes with prefix)

**Local notes preservation:**
If the user adds a `## My Notes` section at the bottom of the file, `atlit pull` should preserve it across updates. This lets you annotate tickets locally.

### Phase 3 — Sync & Diff (Days 8–10) [DONE]

**Goal:** Keep local files fresh with minimal effort.

- [x] `atlit sync` — Re-pull all locally saved tickets that have been updated on Jira since last fetch
  - Threshold JQL: `key in (...) AND updated > "<oldest local fetch>"`, batched at 100 keys per query
  - Preserves `## My Notes` and keeps `## Comments` / `## Pull Requests` when those aren't fetched; per-ticket errors are reported and skipped
- [x] `atlit sync --project PROJ` — Sync only tickets whose key starts with that prefix; `--dry-run` lists what would sync without fetching
- [x] `atlit diff <TICKET-KEY>` — Fetch the latest from Jira and print a unified diff vs. the local file (nothing written)
  - `--color auto|always|never` (auto = color only on a TTY); local-only `## My Notes` / `## Pull Requests` (and `## Comments` when not fetched) excluded to avoid phantom diffs
- [x] `atlit status` — Local-only overview (no API calls): total, stale (>24h) / very-stale (>7d) counts, grouped by project with per-ticket fetch age

### Phase 4 — Search & List (Days 11–13)

**Goal:** Browse and search tickets without leaving the terminal.

- [ ] `atlit list` — List locally saved tickets (from filesystem)
  - Show: key, title, status, last fetched
  - Flags: `--sort`, `--filter-status`
- [x] `atlit search` — Search Jira and list results as a stdout table (DONE, 2026-06-24)
  - Preset filters: `--status` (comma -> `status in (...)`), `--assignee` (name/email resolved to an account via user-search), `--mine` (`assignee = currentUser()`), composed with `AND` and scoped to `default_project` (`--project` / `--all-projects` override the scope)
  - `--jql "<raw>"` advanced escape hatch (mutually exclusive with the preset filters); `--limit` caps rows shown
  - Folds in the planned `atlit mine` (now `atlit search --mine`)
  - See `docs/I24062026_jt-search.md`
- [ ] `atlit sprint` — Show current sprint board for default project
- [ ] `atlit pull --jql <JQL>` — Bulk pull all tickets matching a query
  - e.g., `atlit pull --jql "sprint = currentSprint() AND assignee = currentUser()"`
  - Great for pulling your entire sprint at once

### Phase 5 — Quality of Life (Days 14–16)

**Goal:** Polish the experience.

- [ ] `atlit alias` — Create short aliases for common JQL queries
  - `atlit alias add wip "assignee = currentUser() AND status = 'In Progress'"`
  - `atlit wip` → runs the saved query
- [ ] Shell completions (bash, zsh, fish) — auto-complete ticket keys from local files
- [ ] `atlit export <TICKET-KEY> --format json` — Export as JSON (for programmatic use)
- [ ] `atlit clean` — Remove local files for tickets that are Done/Closed
- [ ] `atlit log <TICKET-KEY>` — Show pull history (when was this ticket last fetched?)
- [ ] Rich terminal output with color (but plain text when piped — detect TTY)
- [ ] `--output` flag on all commands: `table`, `json`, `markdown`, `plain`
- [ ] Man pages / `atlit help <command>` with examples

### Phase 6 — Stretch Goals (Future)

- [ ] `atlit watch <TICKET-KEY>` — Poll for changes and notify (desktop notification)
- [ ] `atlit comment <TICKET-KEY> "message"` — Post a comment from CLI
- [ ] `atlit transition <TICKET-KEY> "In Review"` — Change ticket status
- [ ] Confluence integration: `atlit pull --include-confluence` fetches linked Confluence pages
- [ ] Git integration: `atlit pull --from-branch` infers ticket key from current branch name (e.g., `feature/PROJ-123-oauth`)
- [ ] MCP server mode: expose as a tool for Claude Desktop / Claude Code
- [ ] Offline full-text search across all local tickets (using bleve or similar)

### Phase 7 — Bitbucket PR support (`atlit pr`) [DONE]

**Goal:** Pull a Bitbucket Cloud PR (diff + comments + metadata) into a local
markdown file for code-review context, mirroring `atlit pull` for tickets.

Read-only, self-serve via a scoped Bitbucket API token — useful when the official
Atlassian MCP Bitbucket integration isn't available.

- [x] Milestone 0 — auth spike: validated `email:token` + read scopes against `api.bitbucket.org`
- [x] Milestone 1 — `internal/bitbucket` client + `atlit pr <id>` (git-remote inference), `--no-diff`, My Notes preservation, `~/.atlit/prs/<workspace>__<repo>__<id>.md`, Jira-key linking
- [x] `atlit pr list [repo]` — repo-scoped PR table on stdout (`--state` open|merged|declined|all, `--limit`), newest-updated first, Jira-key column; no files written
- [x] Approvals — `Approved by` row in the saved doc + an `APPROVED BY` column in `atlit pr list`, listing who approved (participants decoded on the single GET, added to the list via `fields=+values.participants`)
- [ ] Deferred (v2): write-back (approve/comment/merge), `atlit pr view/open/path`, workspace-wide `atlit pr list --workspace` + `--mine`, `--json`, diff path-filtering, Bitbucket Server/DC

### Phase 8 — Confluence page support (`atlit page`) [DONE]

**Goal:** Pull a Confluence Cloud page (title + metadata + body) into a local markdown
file for offline reading and LLM context, mirroring `atlit pull` for tickets.

Same Atlassian host and Basic auth as Jira, so it reuses the existing Jira token and
the ADF-to-markdown converter (`jira.RenderADF`).

- [x] `internal/confluence` client — `GetPage(id)` against `/wiki/api/v2/pages/{id}?body-format=atlas_doc_format`
- [x] `renderer.RenderPage` — metadata table + `## Content` (ADF body reused via `jira.RenderADF`)
- [x] `atlit page <id | url>` — numeric ID or page URL, reuses the Jira token, `--dry-run`, My Notes preservation, `~/.atlit/pages/<space>__<id>__<slug>.md` (`pages_dir`)
- [ ] Deferred (v2): child-page expansion, page comments, attachments/labels, `atlit page view/open/path/list`, CQL search, sync/diff for pages, scoped-token `atlit auth confluence`

### Phase 9 — Image / attachment handling (Tier 1) [DONE]

**Goal:** stop silently dropping embedded images. Render media nodes as markdown
image references and list every attachment with its download URL, for **Jira tickets
and Confluence pages**. Pure markdown — no binaries written (Tier 1).

Root cause was a missing `media` case in the shared ADF converter: images fell
through to `default` and emitted nothing.

- [x] `internal/jira/adf.go` — `media` / `mediaInline` rendering via `mediaMarkdown`
  (external -> `![alt](url)`; file -> `![alt](filename)`, `![image](<id>)` fallback)
- [x] Jira `## Attachments` — `Attachment` field (free in the existing fetch) +
  `RenderIssue` section
- [x] Confluence `## Attachments` — `GetPageAttachments` (paginated) + `RenderPage`
  section, relative `downloadLink` resolved to absolute via `absURL`
- [ ] Deferred (Tier 2): opt-in `--assets` to download images into `<key>_assets/`
  and rewrite refs to relative paths (self-contained, offline, multimodal); Bitbucket
  PR image download

### Phase 10 — Ticket write-back (`atlit push`) [DONE]

**Goal:** Push locally-edited description sections back to Jira — the write
counterpart to `atlit pull`, and the tool's first write operation (everything
through Phase 9 is read-only).

Deliberately narrow: only named sections of the description are editable, so a
stray local edit elsewhere can never clobber the remote ticket. This is the first
of the write-backs; `atlit comment` / `atlit transition` (Phase 6) remain pending.

- [x] `internal/jira` — `MarkdownToADF` (markdown -> ADF nodes), `SpliceSection`
  (replace a heading's body in a description ADF, or append the section if absent),
  `UpdateDescription` (`PUT /rest/api/3/issue/{key}` with the new `description`)
- [x] `atlit push <TICKET-KEY>` — diff local vs. remote per section, push only the
  changed ones; `--sections` (default `Technical Requirements,Release Notes`),
  `--dry-run` (prints target sections + full ADF). Only the description is written —
  field table, comments, and `## My Notes` are untouched.
- [x] Lost-update guard — re-fetch before writing and refuse if Jira's `updated` is
  newer than the local `fetched`; fail-closed on an unparseable timestamp (parses
  Jira Cloud's non-RFC3339 numeric offsets like `+0700`). Tells the user to re-pull.
- [ ] Deferred (v2): push arbitrary / full-description sections, push `## My Notes`
  as a comment, `--sections` presets, a 3-way merge instead of the hard staleness stop
